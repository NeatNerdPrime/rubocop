= Compatibility

RuboCop targets Ruby 2.0+ code analysis.footnote:[As defined by its reference implementation MRI.]

RuboCop officially supports MRI (a.k.a. CRuby) and JRuby at runtime.

- MRI 2.7+
- JRuby 9.4+

The oldest supported JRuby version is derived from the oldest compatible MRI version.

NOTE: RuboCop might be working with other Ruby implementations as well, but it's tested only on MRI and JRuby.

== Support Matrix

RuboCop generally aims to follow MRI's own support policy - meaning RuboCop would support all officially supported MRI releases.footnote:[Typically the last 3 releases.] To give people extra time for a smooth transition, we've customarily provided support for about one year after EOL of MRI version. footnote:[At the core team's discretion this policy might be waived aside for MRI releases causing significant maintenance overhead.]

The following table is the runtime support matrix.

|===
| Supported runtime Ruby version | Last supported RuboCop version

| 1.9 | 0.41
| 2.0 | 0.50
| 2.1 | 0.57
| 2.2 | 0.68
| 2.3 | 0.81
| 2.4 | 1.12
| 2.5 | 1.28
| 2.6 | 1.50
| 2.7 | -
| 3.0 | -
| 3.1 | -
| 3.2 | -
| 3.3 | -
| 3.4 | -
| 4.0 | -
| 4.1 (experimental) | -
|===

IMPORTANT: The table above is about *runtime* support (which Ruby can run RuboCop itself). *Code analysis* support is broader — RuboCop can analyze code targeting Ruby 2.0+ regardless of the Ruby version it runs on. See xref:configuration.adoc#setting-the-target-ruby-version[`TargetRubyVersion`] for details.

== Parser engines

RuboCop supports two parser backends, configured via
xref:configuration.adoc#setting-the-parser-engine[`ParserEngine`]:

* **`parser_whitequark`** — the https://github.com/whitequark/parser[Parser] gem. Supports analyzing code targeting Ruby 2.0+.
* **`parser_prism`** — the https://github.com/ruby/prism[Prism] translation layer. Supports analyzing Ruby 3.3+ code and tends to be faster.

Since RuboCop 1.75, `parser_prism` is used by default when `TargetRubyVersion` is 3.4 or higher.

== Forward compatibility

RuboCop may ship support for features from in-development Ruby versions before
they are officially released. Such support is considered experimental and may
change to track upstream changes in the Ruby implementation.
