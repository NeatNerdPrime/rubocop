= Getting Started

This guide will get you up and running with RuboCop in a few minutes. RuboCop serves three primary roles:

. *Code style checker* (a.k.a. linter) — enforces style conventions from the https://rubystyle.guide[Ruby Style Guide]
. *Lint tool* — catches bugs and suspicious code, like a smarter `ruby -w`
. *Code formatter* — automatically fixes layout and formatting

== First Run

After xref:installation.adoc[installing RuboCop], just run it from your project's root directory:

[source,sh]
----
$ rubocop
----

RuboCop will recursively check all Ruby files and report any offenses it finds:

----
Inspecting 5 files
.W.C.

Offenses:

lib/foo.rb:2:3: C: Style/IfUnlessModifier: Favor modifier if usage when having a single-line body.
  if something
  ^^
lib/bar.rb:5:5: W: Lint/UselessAssignment: Useless assignment to variable - x.
    x = 42
    ^

5 files inspected, 2 offenses detected
----

Each offense shows the file, line, column, severity (`C` for convention, `W` for warning, `E` for error), the cop name, and a description. The letter on the progress line (`.` = clean, `C`/`W`/`E` = offense found) gives you a quick overview.

== Setting Up Your Project

For an existing project with many offenses, the easiest way to get started is to generate a TODO file:

[source,sh]
----
$ rubocop --auto-gen-config
----

This creates two files:

* `.rubocop_todo.yml` — temporarily disables all current offenses
* `.rubocop.yml` — your configuration file (with `inherit_from: .rubocop_todo.yml` added)

Now `rubocop` will pass cleanly, and you can work through the TODO entries at your own pace. See xref:usage/auto_gen_config.adoc[Auto-generating Configuration] for details.

For a new project, you can generate a starter config file instead:

[source,sh]
----
$ rubocop --init
----

== Customizing RuboCop

All configuration lives in `.rubocop.yml`. Here are a few common adjustments:

[source,yaml]
----
# Increase the maximum line length
Layout/LineLength:
  Max: 120

# Disable a cop entirely
Style/Documentation:
  Enabled: false

# Restrict a cop to specific files
Rails/HasAndBelongsToMany:
  Include:
    - app/models/**/*.rb
----

See xref:configuration.adoc[Configuration] for the full reference.

== Fixing Offenses Automatically

Many cops can autocorrect the problems they find. Use `-a` for safe corrections only, or `-A` to include unsafe ones:

[source,sh]
----
# Safe autocorrections only
$ rubocop -a

# All autocorrections (safe and unsafe)
$ rubocop -A

# Fix only formatting (layout) offenses
$ rubocop -x
----

TIP: Review the diff after running autocorrect, especially with `-A`. See xref:usage/autocorrect.adoc[Autocorrect] for more details on safe vs. unsafe corrections.

== Editor Integration

For the best experience, set up RuboCop in your editor so you get real-time feedback as you type. RuboCop has a xref:usage/lsp.adoc[built-in LSP server] that works with any editor that supports the Language Server Protocol.

The recommended setup for popular editors:

* **VS Code** — Install the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shopify.ruby-lsp[Ruby LSP] extension
* **Emacs** — Use https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot[Eglot] (built-in since Emacs 29) or https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode[lsp-mode]
* **Vim/Neovim** — Use the built-in LSP client or https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale[ALE]

See xref:integration_with_other_tools.adoc[Integration with Other Tools] for more editors and alternative approaches.
